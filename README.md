# New Relic Monthly Lookback Nerdpack

This is me dipping my toes in [programmability using New Relic One](https://developer.newrelic.com/open-source/nerdpacks). Don't expect clean production ready code from me just yet.

## Getting started

First, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you're unsure whether you have one or both of them installed, run the following command(s) (If you have them installed these commands will return a version number, if not, the commands won't be recognized):

```bash
git --version
npm -v
```

Next, clone this repository and run the following scripts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gspncr/nr-monthly-lookback.git
cd nr-monthly-lookback
nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf
npm install
npm start
```

Visit [https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), navigate to the Nerdpack, and :sparkles:

## Deploying this Nerdpack

Open a command prompt in the nerdpack's directory and run the following commands.

```bash
# this is to create a new uuid for the nerdpack so that you can deploy it to your account
nr1 nerdpack:uuid -g [--profile=your_profile_name]
# to see a list of APIkeys / profiles available in your development environment, run nr1 credentials:list
nr1 nerdpack:publish [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:deploy [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:subscribe [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
```
